# Pokemon-Virtual-Life
Project Description:
* Goal: simulate different aspects of being a Pokémon trainer
* What the user can expect: the user will be able to create 1 of 4 different types of Pokémon of their choosing. They will have various ways to interact with their Pokémon from a menu that will then execute the option they chose.
* How is it unique: This virtual life puts the user in the shoes of a real Pokémon trainer. They are in charge of training, taking care of, and improving their Pokémon. The virtual life reflects real-life aspects of taking care of pets, but with Pokémon. For example, if you give your Pokémon a treat, its happiness will increase.

# How to Run the Program
The user will begin to run the program and choose their type of Pokémon pet they would like to take care of. Then they will pick from a list of options to interact with their pet. Random events will occur at random times. The user will be able to interact with their pet as long as it is still alive.

# Overview of Program Features
* Users can feed, train, put their Pokémon to sleep, play with their Pokémon, use their Pokémon's unique behavior, and display their Pokémon's data.
* The program checks if their Pokémon is alive.
* The program also makes random events occur.
