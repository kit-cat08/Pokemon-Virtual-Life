# Pokemon-Virtual-Life
Project Description:
* Goal: simulate different aspects of being a Pokémon trainer
* What the user can expect: the user will be able to create 1 of 4 different types of Pokémon of their choosing. They will have various ways to interact with their Pokémon from a menu that will then execute the option they chose.
* How is it unique: This virtual life puts the user in the shoes of a real Pokémon trainer. They are in charge of training, taking care of, and improving their Pokémon. The virtual life reflects real-life aspects of taking care of pets, but with Pokémon. For example, if you give your Pokémon a treat, its happiness will increase.
